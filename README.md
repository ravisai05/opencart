# OpenCart Automated Testing Framework 🛒✨

Welcome to the OpenCart Automated Testing Framework project! This repository contains a robust testing framework designed to streamline and enhance the testing process for OpenCart, the popular open-source e-commerce platform.

## Key Features:

### Selenium Automation 🔧
- Automation of repetitive tasks using Selenium for consistent and reliable testing of OpenCart's web interfaces.

### Java Programming ☕
- Implementation in Java for flexibility and scalability, providing a solid foundation for building a robust testing framework.

### TestNG Integration 📝
- Seamless integration with TestNG, a testing framework inspired by JUnit and NUnit. This facilitates efficient test configuration and parallel execution, ensuring comprehensive testing and reporting of OpenCart features.

### Hybrid Framework 🔄
- Utilization of a Hybrid Framework that combines the best features of both data-driven and keyword-driven frameworks. This approach enhances maintainability, scalability, and reusability of test scripts, making it adaptable to changes in the OpenCart application.

### Page Object Model (POM) 🖥️
- Implementation of the Page Object Model to enhance test maintenance and readability. Each web page in OpenCart is represented as a Java class, encapsulating the corresponding page's elements and actions. This modular structure improves code organization and makes it easier to manage changes in the application.
